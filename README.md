# Covidtracker
This Project can help track and predict the number of cases and deaths of a country on a particular date.
The Machine learning model uses linear regression to extrapolate the data and make 
future predictions.
It can also be used as a covid 19 tracker as it has already registered the previous data. 
It can be used to conduct studies on the flow of the virus during its initial stages since 
November 2019.
